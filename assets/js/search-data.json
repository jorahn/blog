            "title": "Giving Zero Shot Predictions with CLIP a Try",
            "content": "The CLIP paper and repo show a straightforward way to use the model for zero shot image classification. CLIP consists of two model components: a vision model and a language model. While the language model is a basic Transformer, the vision model can be either a modified ResNet or a VisionTransformer. The models have been pretrained on 400m image-text-pairs in a contrastive setting. . CLIP mainly provides APIs to encode images or text into this learned latent space. After encoding a list of images, this can be utilized to find the image closest to an encoded text prompt. Alternatively a list of text options can be encoded an utilized to find the best match to an encoded image. . The latter option is presented as Zero Shot Prediction, effectively creating a custom classifier from text options and then retrieving the classification results for an encoded image. It‚Äôs called Zero Shot, because the CLIP model was never trained on these labels. . As detailed by OpenAI in the CLIP paper an for example by the [https://twitter.com/BigscienceW/status/1429787756063043588?s=20] (BigScience working group on Prompt Engineering), the framing of the classification label text playes a big role. E.g. instead of labels cat and dog a better performance can usually be achieved if the labels a photo of a cat and a photo of a dog are chosen. . I‚Äôve conducted some initial tests and found, that CLIP (ViT-B/16) can zero shot recognize patterns in fashion (e.g. dots, stripes, flowers, checkered, print, ‚Ä¶) with ~80% accuracy without significant prompt engineering or model fine tuning on additional data. . The work on https://github.com/FreddeFrallan/Multilingual-CLIP fine tuning of CLIP shows interesting ways of more traditional optimization approaches building upon the extensively pretrained model. . More to come, no doubt! .",

# Why?

I've wanted to put all my content into one place for some time. 
Putting things in writing requires more rigorous thinking, so this is mainly meant for myself.

Eventually, you may find my thoughts or ideas on topics like:
- Machine Learning & Data Science
- Python Programming
- Data Warehouses
- Digital Advertising
- and other topics...

Like [so many](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/posts/clip-art/) [others](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2021/08/11/vqgan-list/), 
I've recently spent [some time](https://twitter.com/rahnjonathan/status/1413950870753095681) playing with VQGAN+CLIP.

Yesterday, this resulted in three new smartphone wallpapers. They are different steps in the VQGAN training process based on the prompt "infinity pool gazing into eternity with bright sunshine":

And this is a video of the training process:
